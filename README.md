## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple and ligtweight website server with Golang. Golang is a very robust and fast programming language. We will build this with only Golang no extra dependencies. On linux the build size is 6.0M.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Golang runtime is needed to be installed to get this project running.

### Installing

Install Golang by visiting [Go.dev](https://go.dev/learn/) to install Golang on your machine. The installation binaries are available for any Operating System (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

Just clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devvspaces/golang_web_server
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The default root directory for static files is the `website` directory. You can add more files there as you want.

To run the server
```bash
cd golang_web_server
go run main.go
```

Visit your localhost [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the website. By defualt this uses your index.html file in the root folder as the index.
